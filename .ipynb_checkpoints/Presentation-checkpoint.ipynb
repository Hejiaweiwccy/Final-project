    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the weirdest activity you can imagine? I hope that walking your pet fish was your first thought, because it was ours. Now lets take that silly idea and make it comically practical. You would need a place to walk your fish. At first, we thought of public rivers, ponds, and lakes. However, when talking about the neighborhoods around Pittsburgh the rivers dominate the waterways. And what if a much bigger fish is lurking in that murky water waiting to eat your beloved pet? Instead, we turned to public pools. Assuming your fish is supernatural and can survive in chlorine dense waters, but that is a given. Now you do not want someone to mistake your pet fish for one that is meant to be cooked right? So we also analyzed local fish fry locations in order to avoid thoes areas. And to top everything off, you and your fish deserve the highest air quality. So we also made sure that the local air quality was up to standard. But in the end its all about your fish's happiness. So we will combine all these metrics into a *Fish Enjoyment Score* to ultimatly conclude the best neighborhood to walk your fish.\n",

    "## The Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Fish Enjoyment Score* is the ultimate fish walkability metric created by analyzing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of fish fries.\n",
    "2. The number of public pools.\n",
    "3. The air quality of the area.\n",

    "To reach our conclusing we analyzed the following data sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Pittsburgh Fish Fry Locations](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-fish-fry-map)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This dataset contains lists of local fish fry locations of the last 5 years.\n",
